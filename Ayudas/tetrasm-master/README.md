## Features

- Ghost
- Preview
- Hold
- Scoring
- Levels with increasing gravity
- Line clear "animation"
- Lock delay with limited movement
- Pause

## Binaries

ELF binaries and ISO images can be downloaded on the [releases][releases] page.

[releases]: https://github.com/programble/tetrasm/releases

## Dependencies

- [NASM][nasm], with support for `elf32` output format
- Linker capable of emulating `elf_i386`
- `genisoimage` (from [cdrkit][cdrkit]) or `mkisofs` (from [cdrtools][cdrtools])

If the system linker does not support emulating `elf_i386`, a cross-linker can
be built from [GNU binutils][binutils]. Use `./configure --target i386-elf`,
then set `LD = i386-elf-ld`.

To use `mkisofs` instead of `genisoimage`, set `GENISOIMAGE = mkisofs`.

Make variables can be set on the command line or in `config.mk`.

[cdrtools]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdrtools
[binutils]: http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/

## Build

```
make
```

This will assemble and link a multiboot ELF file, `tetrasm.elf`.

The default build is `debug`, which includes debug symbols and runtime debug
functions. The `release` build excludes these.

```
make BUILD=release
```

There is also a test build, which features tests of the core functions rather
than the game.

```
make BUILD=test
```

## ISO

```
make iso
```

This will create a bootable ISO using GRUB Legacy, `tetrasm.iso`.

## Emulation

```
make qemu BUILD=release
```

This will boot `tetrasm.elf` in QEMU using multiboot.
If run in the debug build, waits for a debugger to attach.

```
make qemu-iso BUILD=release
```

This will boot `tetrasm.iso` in QEMU.

## Debugging

```
make gdb
```

This will attach GDB to QEMU started from `make qemu`.
